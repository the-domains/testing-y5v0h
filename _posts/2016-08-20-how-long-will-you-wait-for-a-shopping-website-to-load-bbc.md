  How long will you wait for a website to load before you give up and go
  somewhere else? Ten seconds? Twenty seconds? Apparently, nearly half of us
  won't wait even three seconds. If a shopping website doesn't load its content
  within that time, many of us are so impatient we'll immediately go somewhere
  else.
